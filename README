BDIO - Binary Data I/O
----------------------

BDIO is a file format for structured binary data. The 
format specification can be found on www.bdio.org
Or in the doc folder of this distribution.

BDIO is also a library, in which essential tools for
reading, writing and manipulating bdio files are 
implemented. A full implementation in C is provided here,
and a partial implementation in MATLAB (reading bdio files) 
as well.

In addition this distribution contains several command line tools
and a test-suite.

  was developed by Hubert Simma and Tomasz Korzec
- The BDIO library implementation in C and MATLAB is by Tomasz Korzec, with
  contributions by Alberto Ramos (MD5 checksums)

  release, was written by Alexander Peslyak
